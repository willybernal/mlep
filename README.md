# MLE+
MLE+ is an open-source Matlab/Simulink toolbox for co-simulation with the whole-building energy simulator EnergyPlus. It is designed for engineers and researchers who are familiar with Matlab and Simulink and want to use these software tools in building energy simulation.

**NOTE:** MLE+ has been tested on Matlab 2015a running on Mac and Windows. 

# Installation
1. Download MLE+
You can download the latest version from here ([Visit GitHub!](https://www.github.com)) or clone this repository

2. Extract files
Extract all files to a directory in your computer, for example **C:\software\mlep**.

3. Matlab
Open Matlab and change the current directory to the **C:\software\mlep\MLE+** folder that has just been created.

4. Run installMlep.m
In Matlab, run the installation script installMlep.m located in **C:\software\mlep\MLE+\installMlep.m** and follow the instructions. This will install the GUI Layout Toolbox and add the necessary paths to the Matlab environment automatically.

  * NOTE: Read further installation instructions on **installMlep.m**

5. Installation Screen
At this point, the installation screen in Figure 2 will appear. Here you need to specify the paths to EnergyPlus main Directory and the path to the folder with Java binaries. Also, this will replace your RunEPlus.batch file (in Windows).

# MLE+
MLE+ is an open-source Matlab/Simulink toolbox for co-simulation with the whole-building energy simulator EnergyPlus. It is designed for engineers and researchers who are familiar with Matlab and Simulink and want to use these software tools in building energy simulation.

<img align="middle" src="./doc/pics/overview.png" height="250">

MLE+ capabilities include the following:

1. Co-simulation with EnergyPlus.
2. Co-simulation with Simulink models (Simscape).
3. Allow advanced controls in Matlab to operate EnergyPlus buildings.
4. Allow multiple simulation environments to cooperate.
5. Compatible with the [Campus Energy Modeling framework](https://github.com/NREL/CampusEnergyModeling).
6. Allows to seamless integration with Real-Time machine for Hardaware-in-the-loop simulations.

**NOTE:** Other two versons of MLE+ are available:

1. [Legacy Version](http://txn.name/mleplus/mlep_manual.html): This is the original distribution developed by Nghiem Truong.
2. [Graphical user interface](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mbehl/mleplus.html): This is graphical user interface for MLE+. This requires the graphics package from Matlab to run. 

# Current Version
MLE+ examples have been updated to work with E+ 8.6.0.
